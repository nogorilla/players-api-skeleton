# players-api-skeleton

## Instructions

Welcome to an Alchemy Engineering candidate assignment!

To complete this assignment, you will create the API to power the below conditions.  Imagine, if you will, a web
front end that allows admins to create users, who can then create ping pong players. Your job, should
you choose to accept it, is to create an application to cover all of the use cases detailed in the documentation.

As you can see, you'd be better suited to use node to complete this task. If you choose not to, however,
the tests in the `test` directory must still pass.

## Tests

```
npm test
```

## User API

Part of the `player-api` is managing admin users who are then able to manage players.
A user can only interact with players they have created themselves.

A user consists of the following information:

```json
{
  "id": "<string>",
  "first_name": "<string>",
  "last_name": "<string>",
  "email": "<string>"
}
```
